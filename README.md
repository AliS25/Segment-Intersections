# Segment-Intersections

**Segment-Intersections** is a web program that detects and highlights segment intersections. It allows the user to create a set of line segments by clicking to draw dots and then clicking on two dots to draw a line segment connecting the two dots. Then the user can click on "switch set" which changes the color of the line segment. The user can then proceed to create line segments belonging to the new set. If line segments from different sets intersect, the program will detect that and overlay the second set on top highlighting the intersection area. The user also has the option to reset the graph panel and start over.
